TI  - Gene silencing based on RNA-guided catalytically inactive Cas9 (dCas9): a new
      tool for genetic engineering in Leptospira.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonosis caused by pathogenic bacteria of the genus 
      Leptospira, which also includes free-living saprophyte strains. Many aspects of
      leptospiral basic biology and virulence mechanisms remain unexplored mainly due
      to the lack of effective genetic tools available for these bacteria. Recently,
      the type II CRISPR/Cas system from Streptococcus pyogenes has been widely used as
      an efficient genome engineering tool in bacteria by inducing double-strand breaks
      (DSBs) in the desired genomic targets caused by an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease
      called Cas9, and the DSB repair associated machinery. In the present work,
      plasmids expressing heterologous S. pyogenes Cas9 in L. biflexa cells were
      generated, and the enzyme could be expressed with no apparent toxicity to
      leptospiral cells. However, L. biflexa cells were unable to repair RNA-guided
      Cas9-induced DSBs. Thus, we used a catalytically dead Cas9 (dCas9) to obtain gene
      silencing rather than disruption, in a strategy called CRISPR interference
      (CRISPRi). We demonstrated complete gene silencing in L. biflexa cells when both 
      dCas9 and single-guide RNA (sgRNA) targeting the coding strand of the
      beta-galactosidase gene were expressed simultaneously. Furthermore, when the
      system was applied for silencing the dnaK gene, no colonies were recovered,
      indicating that DnaK protein is essential in Leptospira. In addition, flagellar
      motor switch FliG gene silencing resulted in reduced bacterial motility. To the
      best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying the CRISPRi system in
      Leptospira and spirochetes in general, expanding the tools available for
      understanding leptospiral biology.

TI  - Developing a Cas9-based tool to engineer native plasmids in Synechocystis sp. PCC
      6803.
PG  - 2305-2314
LID - 10.1002/bit.26747 [doi]
AB  - The oxygenic photosynthetic bacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (S6803) is a
      model cyanobacterium widely used for fundamental research and biotechnology
      applications. Due to its polyploidy, existing methods for genome engineering of
      S6803 require multiple rounds of selection to modify all genome copies, which is 
      time-consuming and inefficient. In this study, we engineered the Cas9 tool for
      one-step, segregation-free genome engineering. We further used our Cas9 tool to
      delete three of seven S6803 native plasmids. Our results show that all three
      small-size native plasmids, but not the large-size native plasmids, can be
      deleted with this tool. To further facilitate heterologous gene expression in
      S6803, a shuttle vector based on the native plasmid pCC5.2 was created. The
      shuttle vector can be introduced into Cas9-containing S6803 in one step without
      requiring segregation and can be stably maintained without antibiotic pressure
      for at least 30 days. Moreover, genes encoded on the shuttle vector remain
      functional after 30 days of continuous cultivation without selective pressure.
      Thus, this study provides a set of new tools for rapid modification of the S6803 
      genome and for stable expression of heterologous genes, potentially facilitating 
      both fundamental research and biotechnology applications using S6803.

AB  - In the last few decades, genomic manipulation has made significant progress as a 
      result of the development of recombinant DNA technologies; however, more often
      than not, these techniques have been costly and labor intensive. In contrast,
      recently developed next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have provided a 
      cheaper, faster, and easier process to study genomics. In particular, an NGS
      technique emerged from bacterial CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) as a
      revolutionary method to modify, regulate, or mark specific genomic sequences on
      virtually any organism. A later adaptation of this bacterial defense mechanism
      that successfully and permanently edits dysfunctional genes and corrects missing 
      proteins has resulted in a new era for disease genetic engineering. Clinical
      trials using this technique are already being performed, and the applicability of
      CRISPR-Cas9 techniques is actively being investigated using in vivo studies.
      However, the concept of genome correction poses great concerns from a regulatory 
      perspective, especially in terms of security, so principles for the regulation of
      these methodologies are being established. We delved into CRISPR-Cas9 from its
      natural and ortholog origins to its engineered variants and behaviors to present 
      its notable and diverse applications in the fields of biotechnology and human
      therapeutics.
